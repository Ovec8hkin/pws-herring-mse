# Management Strategy Evaluation Framework for Prince William Sound Herring

An early trial version of the MSE framework for PWS herring.

The simulation loops functions correctly, but there are many parts of the operating model that need improvement before the framework is ready for deployment and considered credible.

This repo mostly serves to allow me to deploy the simulation loop to remote compute resources to perform more stringent efficiency testing.
